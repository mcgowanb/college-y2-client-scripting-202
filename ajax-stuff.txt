AJAX stands for asynchronous javascript and xml. Its used to make asynchronus calls to a webserver (in the background) to update part of the page content and other functionality without having to reload the entire page

XMLHttpRequest() is the JS api that provides functionality to make ajax calls

onreadystatechange is an event handler that's triggered every time the state of an XMLHttpRequest changes. It can generally be assigned to a callback function to take some action depending on the current ready state as it changes

readyState returns the state of the current XMLHttpRequest, and can be a number between 0 (unsent) and 4 (done)

responseText contains the response that's received from the request once its compelted., it can be null if the request failed or has not yet been sent

open() initialises the request

send() sends the request that's been created and opened
